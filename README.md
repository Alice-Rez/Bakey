## About

<h3 style="color:#ED8DB2">Origin of Bakey</h3>

Bakey was a vision of [Ola](https://github.com/OlaFro) for the final project together with [Alice](https://github.com/Alice-Rez) and [willoid](https://github.com/willoid) after [our](https://bakey-app.herokuapp.com/about-us) one year web development course at [DCI](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/).

During the Covid19 lockdowns from 2020 and 2021 cafés weren't allowed to offer nothing but meals to-go. Many of them wouldn't even take the risk of producing meals that wouldn't find a buyer and would just remain closed. With Bakey cafés can easily publish campaigns to sell their cakes and meals in a crowdfunding system: they indicate how many portions they need to sell for the production to be profitable, then clients can buy portions and invite their friends to buy other portions. If the minimum goal is reached, cafés get the money to start baking and keep their business alive! 


 <h3 style="color:#ED8DB2">Development of Bakey</h3>

Take a look at our thorough [technical guidelines](./Technical-guidelines.md) to learn everything about the technologies applied during the development.

Bakey was developed in seven weeks between February and March 2021, including a long planning of every feature and the different sprints. While [Ola](https://github.com/OlaFro) took over the role of product owner and front-end lead, [Alice](https://github.com/Alice-Rez) lead the back-end and was the tech-mastermind but all three of us worked fullstack in this MERN project. 


## How to use Bakey

Please note that all products and functionalities are mockups, so please help us by entering also fake and open source data. You can navigate as a [client](#bakey-as-a-client) or as a [café owner](#bakey-as-owner). If you add or find data that is protected, write us a short message at bakeyapp@gmail.com to get it removed.

 <h3 id="bakey-as-a-client" style="color:#ED8DB2; font-size: 30px;" align="center">Bakey as a client</h3>

- Start selecting one of the available cities from the [landing page](https://bakey-app.herokuapp.com/) or [register](https://bakey-app.herokuapp.com/registration/user).
- You will see a list of the local cafés and their offers. The map shows you their location for better orientation. Feel free to filter according your dietary restrictions. To get redirected to a café profile, click on their card or on the respective pin on the map.

<h3 align="center"><img src="./readme_assets/cafeslist.png"/></h3>

- The café profile shows you the open campaigns, their progress and the buying options. If you are not logged in, you will be redirected to the login when you choose an option to buy but don't be worried, your choice is saved and you will get back automatically to your order summary after registering and logging in.
- In the order confirmation you can modify your order before the checkout.
- Proceed to checkout with mockup payment data and ask friends to buy other portions to support the campaign. 


 <h3 id="bakey-as-owner" style="color:#ED8DB2; font-size: 30px;" align="center">Bakey as a café owner</h3>

- Register [here](https://bakey-app.herokuapp.com/registration/cafe). Enter a real address and fake names and emails. We have cafés in Hamburg, Düsseldorf and Leipzig but please feel free to try with another city.
- After logging in you will be redirected to your empty dashboard. Try to create a new offer. You will need a picture smaller than 2MB and in a <span style="color:#ED8DB2"> **square format** </span>. 
- The dashboard will be updated with your offer. 

<h3 align="center"><img src="./readme_assets/dashboard.png"/></h3>

- To see some progress, register and login as a client (e.g. in another browser) and buy the portions. Click on pickups to see campaigns that were sold out and on expired offers to see the ones which weren't successful. You can complete the sold out campaigns by sending a fake confirmation to clients. Then, imagine the buyers picked up their portions. Click on finish and the campaign will be stored in "archive".

<h3 align="center"><img src="./readme_assets/sold.png"/></h3>

- If you create an offer and it expires before it gets sold out, you will find it in expired offers. If you wish, you can archive the order or reactivate it. Archived order can also be reactivated.

<h3 align="center"><img src="./readme_assets/expired.png"/></h3>

- To reactivate an expired or archived order, you will get to a pre-filled form where you only have to re-enter a new pick-up date. Of course you can modify any field you wish and can try to reprice it or change the pieces. Click on cancel if you wish to create a complete new offer.

- This application puts the cafés first and creating a nice café profile is easy. By clicking on settings, café owners have the chance to upload a cover photo (1200 x 400 px) and a logo (square format) and write a nice description. The button café profile in the dashboard redirects to the public profile of the café. Give it a try!
