        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>
          We are Alice, Ola, and Willy - three friends that studied together Web
          Development at{" "}
          <a href="https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/">
            Digital Career Institute
          </a>{" "}
          in Leipzig in 2020. We've started as absolute beginners having no clue
          about HTML or CSS and now, a year later, we are proudly presenting You
          Bakey - our final project, a full-stack Single Page Application
          created with MERN-stack.ðŸ¥³.
        </p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Our motivation by choosing the topic of the final project was to
          create a tool that would support local cafÃ©s during the lockdown.
          Right now they only can offer their products to-go, but many of them
          are not even taking the risk of producing food, that might not find a
          client. With an application like Bakey, they would be able to offer
          their products in short crowdfunding-like campaigns and prepare the
          food with guaranteed payment and pick up.
        </p>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          We have created our project from scratch in seven weeks between
          February and March 2021. Before we've started to code, we discussed
          the functionalities, planned the order of executing the tasks, and set
          the goals for the upcoming sprints. At the end of February, we've
          deployed our Alpha version, still very bare but functioning, that
          we've sent to our friends for testing. Two weeks later we were ready
          to deploy the Beta version and prepared for the Final Presentation
          where Bakey would be introduced.
        </p>
        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          Bakey is done with React and Styled-Components in the front-end and
          node.js and Express.js in the back-end. For the database, we've used
          MongoDB with Mongoose and Mongo Atlas. We are using ecrypting
          (hashing) of the passwords, JWT and store the order data in the
          session storage. During the work on Bakey we've used Agile Project
          Management.
        </p>
        <h3>Remote</h3>
        <p>
          Although we live in the same city, during the whole project we haven't
          met even once. We communicated daily via Zoom and Slack, we've used
          Trello to organize the work, Miro and Figma for conceptual tasks, and
          of course Github to merge our code into the project.
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          We would love to hear your feedback about Bakey! If you have any
          suggestions, please share them with us via{" "}
